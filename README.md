# LALA Website React

Based on [dideldumthecat/lala-website](https://github.com/dideldumthecat/lala-website), which uses plain JavaScript and gulp, The LALA Website is implemented completely in React and uses Vite as a development and build framework.

## Getting Started

### Fonts

The **Cathedral Open** font files must be obtained separately due to licensing restrictions. Once acquired, place them in the `public/fonts` folder.

### Run the Project

To run and work with the project locally:

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Run the development environment:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ````

### Build the project

If you just want to build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will place all necessary files in the dist folder, ready for deployment.

## And finally, don't forget...

... to keep The LALA alive and flowing!
