# LALA Website

The LALA Website is a creative project showcasing a grid-based design with interactive elements. The website leverages modern frontend technologies and tools like Sass, CSS Grid, and JavaScript to provide a dynamic user experience.

## Getting Started

### Fonts

The **Cathedral Open** font files must be obtained separately due to licensing restrictions. Once acquired, place them in the `public/fonts` folder.

### Run the Project

To run and work with the project locally:

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2. Run the development environment (including BrowserSync for live reloading):

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ````

### Build the project

If you just want to build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will place all necessary files in the dist folder, ready for deployment.

## And finally, don't forget...

... to keep The LALA alive and flowing!
